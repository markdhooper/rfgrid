# rfgrid
A computer peripheral which provides immersive tabletop gaming experiences using RFID technology.

## background
rfgrid started as my senior design project for my Bachelor of Electrical Engineering degree. This repo is where I'll be working on improving the hardware and software in order to bring an affordable platform for immersive tabletop gaming. 

## goals
### hardware re-design - (currently in progress)
I am currently working on re-designing the hardware from the ground up using what I have learned from constructing the original prototype. I will document the engineering and design process both here and on my YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChyerhf01zG7VYn24AjJyBA

### Unity developer tools
I am looking to implement a real-time communication interface for Unity to take advantage of the powerful game-creation tools available therein. 

### standalone applications
I'll work on developing applications for the platform to demonstrate what is possible to achieve with the device.

### produce hardware kits
Once the details are figured out with the hardware, I want to produce DIY kits for people to try out for themselves.
